            <h1>. ðŸŒ¸ Razia â€“ The Girl with a Dream</h1>
            <p>
              Razia, the younger sister, was a bright and ambitious girl. Ever
              since she was a child, she dreamed of becoming a doctor. She spent
              her days studying by the dim glow of a lantern, her eyes filled
              with hope and determination. Their family was poor, and affording
              an education was a struggle, but Razia never let that stop her.
              She believed that knowledge was her way out of povertyâ€”a way to
              heal not just her family but the world.

            <h1>ðŸ¦‹ Rabia â€“ The Heart of the Home</h1>
            <p>
              Rabia, the elder sister, was different. She found joy in the
              warmth of home, in the simple pleasure of cooking for her family,
              and in the laughter of her two young sons. She had always been the
              protector, the one who sacrificed her dreams so Razia could chase
              hers. Rabia's world revolved around love, family, and creating a
              home filled with happiness.
